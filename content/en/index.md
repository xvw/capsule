synopsis: 
  Hello, my name is **Xavier Van de Woestyne**, and you've landed on
  the index of my *personal website* (though it doesn't deal much with
  *personal things*, so it's fine). This page **is an English-language 
  summary of my personal website** (written in French); it essentially 
  follows the structure of a traditional blog.
